# Basic class design
Creating a browser class which takes a url , maintain a back and forward navigation.

Well, Its not a actual browser, if thats what you are thinking. Does not involve in any real browser functionality, its a simplest Browser class which mimics certain behavior of a browser as follows.

Here is what is expected out of this

 1. It takes a String ( url ) in a function ( choose your name), and displays "Welcome to <domain name> ( excludes the www or the
    com|in... part)
    
 2. It also has a function which tells you whether there is anything left in the back navigation list.
 3. Has a function which tells you whether there is anything left in the forward navigation list.
 4. And surprisingly enough,:) it also lets you go forward or go backward, and upon doing so , it browses the respective navigation based on the list.
  


Create a console based application with a class named Browser ( I am not giving away the other functional details; method names etc).
